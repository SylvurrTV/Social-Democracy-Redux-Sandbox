= Schleicher's Reichsexekutions

In his work to eliminate the continued violence in the streets and any potential threat against him, Schleicher and [+ president +] have been imposing federal interventions against unruly or disobedient states, placing them under direct government control, and in areas without direct Reichsexekutions been forcing state governments to nonetheless essentially subjugate themselves to central government control and reshuffle their cabinets in accordance with Schleicher's rule.

Claiming, funnily, to champion a fight for democracy and the constitution, the Nazis have mobilized the SA to defend the state governments to which they are sympathetic from Schleicher's imposition of military force. Fighting erupts and spirals into civil war.
