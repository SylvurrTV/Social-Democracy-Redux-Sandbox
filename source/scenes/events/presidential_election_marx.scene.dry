The presidential election is coming up soon. [? if spd_in_government = 0 : While the position of Chancellor is typically more important, recent governments have depended on the president's emergency decree powers, making the office vital. ?] [? if hitler_deported==0 : The Nazis will run Hitler, while the KPD will run Thälmann. A victory for Hitler would mean the end of parliamentary democracy, and the beginning of an era of unspeakable horrors. ?][? if hitler_deported==1 : Since Hitler has been deported, the Nazis will run Hermann Göring in his stead. He is widely seen as a proxy for Hitler, who, despite his legal persecution, retains a popular base who wishes to see him returned to Germany. Meanwhile, the KPD will run Ernst Thälmann. ?] The DNVP too has entered the race, running the intensely antisemitic Theodor Duesterburg, co-leader of Der Stalhelm.

Then, of course, there is the incumbent President Marx. So long as we continue to support him, he is almost certain to stay in the race to prevent the rise of an extremist president from either the left or the right.

# if hitler is deported, who would nsdap run? Duesterberg? or Goering?
# Goering runs, essentially as a proxy for Hitler, who is now stateless.

It takes effort to run a somewhat unexpected campaign. First, Braun has to be convinced to run. He himself had supported backing Marx, and it takes a good deal of prodding to convince him of his destiny.

Without our support, Wilhelm Marx has dropped out. The miniscule remnants of the Democratic Party (now called the German State Party) will likely support us. Who else will? Can we convince the Center to support Braun? What about the Communists?

Supporting Thälmann is rather unpopular in our party, even if the Communists accept our support. Are we sure?
