= Expropriation of the Princes

The referendum on the expropriation of the princes has been held, and the results are in.

@defeated
view-if: petition_support < 50 and (not princes_constitutional or princes_support < 50)
on-arrival: kpd_relation -= 5; socialism -= 2

Unfortunately, the referendum has failed, with only [+ referendum_turnout +]% voting [? if princes_constitutional : and [+ princes_support +] in favor?]. Nonetheless, it has demonstrated the immense support of the workers' parties and shown that the German left is not dead. Perhaps, if this momentum continues, the socialist parties will achieve a victory come the next elections.

@success
view-if: petition_support >= 50 or (princes_constitutional and princes_support >= 50)
on-arrival: rural_spd += 5*(1-dissent); unemployed_spd += 3*(1-dissent); unemployed_kpd += 2; workers_spd += 4*(1-dissent); workers_dnvp -= 5; rural_dnvp -= 5; old_middle_dnvp -= 2; old_middle_spd += 2*(1-dissent); nationalism -= 5; socialism += 5; kpd_relation += 5; land_reform += 1; unemployed -= 1

With [+ referendum_turnout +]% voting [? if princes_constitutional : and [+ princes_support +]% in favor of the bill ?] the referendum has succeeded! This is a massive victory for the left [? if president == "Hindenburg" :showing that despite the victory of Hindenburg last year, the socialism prevails over reaction?].
