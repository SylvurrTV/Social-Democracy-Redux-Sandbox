Finally, as the country emerges from civil war, presidential elections will be held. [? if not kpd_banned : The KPD is planning to run [? if kpd_party_leader == "Conciliators" : Willi Münzenberg?][? if kpd_party_leader != "Conciliators" : Ernst Thälmann?] ?][? if z_relation < 50 or dvp_banned != 1 or dnvp_banned != 1 :[? if not kpd_banned :, while the?][? if kpd_banned : The?] right rallies behind[? if dnvp_banned != 1 : Oskar Hergt?][? if dnvp_banned and dvp_banned != 1 and dvp_relation < 35 : Hans Luther?][? if dnvp_banned and dvp_banned and president == "Wirth" : Joseph Wirth?][? if dnvp_banned and dvp_banned and president != "Wirth" and z_relation < 50 : Konrad Adenauer?][? if dvp_banned != 1 and dnvp_banned and dvp_relation >= 35 : Otto Gessler ?] ?]. 

[? if president == "Wirth" : Joseph Wirth is tired, but will run for re-election if we support him. ?] We may convince Otto Braun to run, or back another candidate. Kurt Schumacher rose to prominence during the civil war, and we may choose to run him if Otto Braun is unwilling.

Supporting Thälmann is rather unpopular in our party, even if the Communists accept our support. Are we sure?
