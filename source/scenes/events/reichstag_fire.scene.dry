= Reichstag Fire

The Reichstag has been burned to the ground, ostensibly by a foreign communist. Whether their accusations are true or not, the Nazis have used this as a pretext to consolidate power as [+ president +] signs the **Decree of the Reich President for the Protection of People and State**, or **Reichstag Fire Decree** suspending essential civil liberties under the pretext of preventing communist revolution. 

This decree gives [+ chancellor +] wide-ranging powers with which to suppress us and arrest our leaders in the leadup to the [+ next_election_month : month +] election. Despite its blatantly dictatorial nature, there is not much we can do about it.

- @fight: Except fight, before it is too late.
- @lib: We will have to hope for the best.

We mobilize what's left of the Reichsbanner and ADGB to resist this blatant crackdown. [? if kpd_party_leader != "Conciliators" : The KPD, seeing its leaders jailed, is more inclined to join us in our final fight against fascism, but will it be enough? ?]

What can we do? With Prussia gone, there is no way we can resist by force. We will just have to try and deny the Nazis an electoral majority.
