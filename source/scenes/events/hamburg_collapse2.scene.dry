= Dissolution of the Hamburg Landtag

Following the collapse of our national cooperation and further declining relations, the Hamburg DVP has turned on our regional Grand Coalition. Though they cannot remove the state government from power, due to the constructive VONC mechanism, they can dissolve the Landtag by a simple majority vote.

go-to: kpd_responsible if (((kpd_relation < 60 and kpd_party_leader != "Conciliators") or (kpd_relation < 30 and kpd_party_leader == "Conciliators")) and (dissolve_hl-kpd_hl < 50))

Ultimately, with [+ dissolve_hl +]% in favor, the Landtag is dissolved. [? if not ((kpd_relation < 70 and kpd_party_leader != "Conciliators") or (kpd_relation < 50 and kpd_party_leader == "Conciliators")) : This is due to the KPD's crucial vote to dissolve the Landtag. ?]

New elections have been called for [+ hamburg_election_month : month +] [+ hamburg_election_year +].

The KPD's vote to dissolve the Landtag seems to have backfired, as many of their voters, feeling that they are voting not for communism but for the Nazism that the KPD is enabling in their virulent focus on attacking Social Democracy, have jumped ship to the SPD.

@landtag_not_dissolved

Surprisingly, the motion fails, with only [+ dissolve_hl +]% in favor. [? if ((kpd_relation < 70 and kpd_party_leader != "Conciliators") or (kpd_relation < 50 and kpd_party_leader == "Conciliators"))  : This is due to the KPD's crucial vote not to dissolve the Landtag. ?]
